Incero-PHP-SDK
==============

A simple "SDK" for interfacing with the Incero Instant API

The easiest way to get started is to simply add your API key to the settings file (within the
settings folder), and dig into the examples provided in the "examples" directory. 

There you can easily:
* deploy a single server

* deploy multiple servers at once, deploying alternative models in the order you specify if there
  is an availability issue.

* Terminate all your servers.

Please note that this is completely "unofficial" and has not been reviewed/supported/tested by 
Incero LLC itself.
